 ✘ ~**Create a mechanism to display statistics**~ Abandoned idea. @low @cancelled (17-03-18 03:20) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✘ ~**Change all synchronous functions to asynchronous**~ Abandoned idea. @low @cancelled (17-03-18 03:20) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ Added another Google Translate method that makes use of the mechanism used by the Google Translate Chrome extension. @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ Added **Transltr** service. The only translation service on the face of the earth with a public API and that makes no use of API keys. Lets enjoy it while it lasts (LOL). @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Test extension on all currently supported versions of Cinnamon** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Switch back to a custom settings window** Cinnamon's native settings system is very practical, but it's also very limited. There are certain settings that can be modified in the gnome-shell extension (the extension Multi Translator is based on) that aren't possible to modify using Cinnamon's native settings system. So, I will give a try to a custom one. @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Provide alternate methods in case translate-shell breaks or doesn't exists (manually configurable or automatic)** There are a total of 3 translation services that doesn't require translate-shell. For now, this should suffice. @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Make Yandex API keys usage random** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Keep looking for a way to reload the themes without the need to restart Cinnamon** Keep in mind the comment block in extension.js>TranslatorExtension>_loadTheme(). @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Implement translation history** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Implement a mechanism to check for dependencies** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Create the translation template** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Create the dark Linux Mint theme** @low @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Add the possibility to select a custom theme** @low @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Add more translation providers:** At least as much as translate-shell supports. @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Add more translation providers that doesn't require the use of translate-shell** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Add Yandex API keys configuration** @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
 ✔ **Add "Service provided by Service provider name" notice** This is needed to comply with the terms of use for the translation services. @high @done (17-03-18 03:19) @project(Multi Translator extension ToDo list)
