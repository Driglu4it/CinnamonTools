## Python modules description

- **app_menu:** The main CLI menu.
- **app_utils:** Utility functions and classes.
- **changelog_sanitizer:** This module is used to *sanitize* all changelogs generated by the `git log` command.
- **cli:** The main CLI application.
- **docopt:** Slightly modified version of the [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) Python module.
    - - Print help "headers" in bold.
- **locale_list:** This module is just a list of locales with their names in English and their endonys (the locale name in the locale language).
- **localized_help_creator:** Localized help system main functions.
- **localized_help_utils:** Localized help system utility functions.
- **menu:** Slightly modified version of the [Menu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Menu) Python module.
    - Changed some default values to suit my needs.
    - Some aesthetic changes for better readability of the menu items on the screen.
    - This modified version doesn't clear the screen every time a menu is opened.
- **mistune:** This [Python module](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) is used to render markdown strings and it's also used by the localized help system. I modified this module to add support for keyboard keys (`kbd` HTML tags). `[[Key]]` will render as `<kbd>Key</kbd>`. The use of this module is to avoid at all cost the use of HTML tags on translatable strings. This will prevent the breakage of the generated HTML pages if an HTML tag is wrongly edited. If a Markdown markup is wrongly edited, the markup characters will not be rendered as HTML, but the HTML page will not break.
- **multi_select:** Slightly modified version of the [picker](https://github.com/MSchuwalow/picker) Python module.
- **pyuca:** This [Python module](https://github.com/jtauber/pyuca) is used to allow the correct sorting of strings with Unicode characters. It is used by the localized help system.
